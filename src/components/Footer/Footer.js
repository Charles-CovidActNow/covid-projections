          How to use this tool
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" component="p" style={{ color: '#222' }}>
          This tool is built to enable political leaders to quickly make
          decisions in their Coronavirus response informed by best available
          data and modeling.
          <br />
          <br />
          Here are the questions we built this tool to answer:
          <ol>
            <li>
              What will the impact be in my region be and when can I expect it?
            </li>
            <li>How long until my hospital system is under severe pressure?</li>
            <li>
              What are my menu of interventions, and how will they address the
              spread of Coronavirus?
            </li>
          </ol>

            This model offers a great tool for state policy staff whose job it
            is to advise the Governor and the Director of Health regarding what
            kinds of policies should be instituted to encourage social
            distancing to minimize contagion with corona virus. Staff need to be
            prepared to defend with comparative data their recommendations
            regarding whether to close schools, close bars, restrict gatherings
            to a select number or encourage non-essential workers to
            telecommute. This web site offers state specific estimates that
            demonstrate the impact of such policies on the curve of infections,
            hospitalizations and deaths in a very sophisticated manner.

          What are the current limitations of the model?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" component="p" style={{ color: '#222' }}>
          Here is a non-exhaustive list:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Only a small fraction of the world has been infected. It’s a new
              disease. Variables will change.
            </li>
            <li>
              R0s for interventions are guesses, in some cases informed by data.
              There is no historical precedent for what is going on right now to
              draw from.
            </li>
            <li>
              The default R0 used in this model is an average. The model does
              not adjust for the population density, culturally-determined
              interaction frequency and closeness, humidity, temperature, etc in
              calculating R0.
            </li>
            <li>
              This is not a node-based analysis, and thus assumes everyone
              spreads the disease at the same rate. In practice, there are some
              folks who are “super-spreaders,” and others who are almost
              isolated. Interventions should be targeted primarily at those most
              likely to spread the disease.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only hospital beds at aggregate are considered. ICU beds and
              ventilators, which are likely to run low before beds, are not
              considered.
            </li>
            <li>
              Demographics, populations, and hospital bed counts are outdated.
              Demographics for the USA as a whole are used, rather than specific
              to each state.
            </li>

            <li>
              In containment cases, we do not deal with the longer-term impacts
              of maintaining containment, primarily the concern with avoiding
              reintroduction of the disease due to incoming travelers. 14-day
              mandatory border quarantines, such as those currently in place in
              China, would likely need to continue until a vaccine or
              therapeutic is developed.
